# Building-Microservices-with-stack_under_flow

I have used basic frontend. My main focus was to learn the basic of backend properly with microservice. I have implemented the frontend using ReactJS and the backend using NodeJS, Nginx, docker.

There are 3 microservices in my backend part:
 - User
 - Post
 - Notification

Before dockerization, I used a "gateway" microservice that functioned similarly to Nginx.
